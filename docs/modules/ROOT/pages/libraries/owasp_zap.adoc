= OWASP ZAP

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project[OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)] is a tool that can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

== Library Configuration Options

.OWASP ZAP Library Configuration Options
|===
| Field | Description | Default Value | Options

| target
| The target url to pentest
| none
| 

| vulnerability_threshold
| Minimum alert level to include in report
| High
| one of "Ignore", "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Informational"

|===

`target` is set to `env.FRONTEND_URL` if available. If not, then it is set to `application_environment.owasp_zap.target` if method if called with penetration_test(<application environment>). If that is null, the URL provided in the Library config target is used. If no URL is provided an error is thrown.

=== Example Configuration Snippet

[source,groovy]
----
application_environments{
  dev{
    owasp_zap{
      target = "https://example.dev.com"
    }
  }
}
libraries{
  owasp_zap{
    target = "https://example.com"
    vulnerability_threshold = "Low"
  }
}
----

Assuming `env.FRONTEND_URL` is null, in this example, Zap would use the target specified in `application_environment.owasp_zap.target`, since it overrides the target specified in `libraries.owasp_zap.target`.
